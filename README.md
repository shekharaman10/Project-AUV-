# Project-AUV-
Project AUV Manipal, founded in 2019, is the underwater robotics student team with a common interest in exploring the field of underwater robotics. Team aims to conceptualize, design, and fabricate Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for both research and competitive purposes. Using state-of-the-art tools and technology, I worked in AI and Robotics subsystem. I also have my hands on experience with Electronics and Control System of AUVs. I worked in Python, C++, and ROS 2 Humble, specializing in AI-driven robotics, computer vision, and deep learning. Skilled in OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. Work on Jetson Orin NX and Raspberry Pi. Experienced in ROS tools like Gazebo for simulation, RViz for visualization, Nav2 for navigation, and SLAM for localization. I have experience with AI model deployment on docker.
